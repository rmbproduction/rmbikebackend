# Speed Optimization Guide for RMBikeBackend

This document outlines the speed optimization features implemented in the backend to improve performance.

## 1. Image Optimization

### Automatic Image Processing

The system now includes automatic image optimization using the `tools.image_optimizer` package:

- **WebP Conversion**: Images are automatically converted to WebP format for better compression
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple size variants are generated for different devices
- **Quality Optimization**: Images are compressed with optimized quality settings

### Configuration

To enable image optimization, set the following in your `.env` file:

```
ENABLE_AUTO_OPTIMIZATION=true
IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_QUALITY=85
IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_MAX_SIZE=1920
```

## 2. Cloudinary Integration

The backend now supports Cloudinary for CDN delivery of media files:

### Configuration

Add your Cloudinary credentials to your `.env` file:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

When properly configured, all media files will be automatically uploaded to Cloudinary and served from their CDN.

## 3. API Response Caching

### Redis Cache

The system uses Redis for caching API responses. To enable:

```
USE_REDIS=true
REDIS_PUBLIC_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1
```

### Cache Decorators

Use the following decorators to cache API responses:

```python
from tools.cache_utils import cache_api_response, CACHE_TIMES

@cache_api_response(timeout=CACHE_TIMES['STATIC'], key_prefix="my_view")
def my_view(request):
    # Your view logic here
    return response
```

Available cache timeouts:
- `STATIC`: 24 hours (for rarely changing data)
- `LOOKUP`: 1 hour (for reference data)
- `DYNAMIC`: 5 minutes (for frequently updated data)
- `USER`: 1 minute (for user-specific data)

## 4. Database Optimizations

### Indexes

The following models have been optimized with database indexes:
- `VehicleModel`
- `VehicleImage`
- `UserVehicle`

### Query Optimizations

- `select_related` is used to reduce database queries
- Composite indexes for frequently joined fields

## 5. Deployment Recommendations

For optimal performance in production:

1. **Enable Redis**: Set `USE_REDIS=true` in your environment
2. **Configure Cloudinary**: Add your Cloudinary credentials
3. **Run Migrations**: Apply the database index migrations
4. **Set Cache Headers**: Configure your web server to set proper cache headers
5. **Enable HTTP/2**: Configure your web server to use HTTP/2

## Monitoring

To monitor the effectiveness of these optimizations:
- Check Redis cache hit rates
- Monitor Cloudinary usage
- Use Django Debug Toolbar in development to identify slow queries
