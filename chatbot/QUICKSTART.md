2. Start the action server:
   ```bash
   rasa run actions
   ```

### Testing Changes

Test your changes using one of these methods:

1. **Rasa Shell** - Direct CLI testing:
   ```bash
   rasa shell
   ```

2. **Interactive Learning** - Improve your model iteratively:
   ```bash
   rasa interactive
   ```

3. **Web Chat** - Test through the web interface
